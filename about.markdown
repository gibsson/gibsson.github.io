I'm Gary, been working on embedded systems for some time, mostly with Linux / Android.

Used to lead the SW team at Boundary Devices for almost 10 years, now freelancing for fun projects!

Starting this blog to share what I find interesting while doing my job.

You can find some of my experiments on GitHub: [gibsson](https://github.com/gibsson)
