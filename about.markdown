I'm Gary, been developing embedded SW solutions for some time now.

Used to lead the SW team at Boundary Devices for almost 10 years, now freelancing for fun projects!

Starting this blog to share what I find interesting while doing my job.

You can find some of my experiments on GitHub: [gibsson](https://github.com/gibsson)
